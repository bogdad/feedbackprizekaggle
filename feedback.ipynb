On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform\\n\\nI think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet. If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, \"It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.\\n\\nPeople thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars. though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars.\\n\\nIt says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform. Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans.\\n\\nThough people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist.</td>\n",

       "0  Making choices in life can be very difficult. People often ask for advice when they can not decide on one thing. It's always good to ask others for their advice when making a choice. When you have multiple opinions you have the ability to make the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice because it can decrease stress levels, a great chance to learn something new, can be very helpful and beneficial.\\n\\nTo begin with, Seeking information from more than one person can decrease stress levels. When making a decision there is a chance that you can become very stressed and overwhelmed. Being stressed can cause a person to give up on what they are doing. Having multiple opinions from people can make choosing an option less difficult and more easier. The information that you receive from others may have a special meaning in the future. Other peoples opinion can make a person feel confident in making the right choice.\\n\\nWhen you ask other people for their opinion you can also learn many new things. Everyone is different and may have more experience than you. Seeking other peoples opinion can cause you to gain a new skill or lesson. For example, someones advice could teach you how to do something the correct way. Many people are very different and have experience different things in life. Seeking advice from others can teach you a lot. We all learn from our mistakes in life, by sharing your past experiences you may prevent someone else from making the same mistake.\\n\\nSeeking others opinion can be very helpful and beneficial.
